# M2 Portfolio
*Deployed Application:* https://blair-d.github.io/M2-Portfolio/
#DESCRIPTION
The motivation for this project was to create a foundation portfolio to which I can dispay my work and showcase my talents. As a student learing the world of code from scratch its important to build the portfolio itself but the contents as well. In this particular project the focus was on using tools like flexbox to improve how the website is displayed accross various platforms.

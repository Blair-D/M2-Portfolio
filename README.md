#DESCRIPTION
The motivation for this project was to improve the accessibility along with ensuring all the links work properly. Everyone visiting this website should have equal access to information and services available. To ensure this website meets this standard of inclusion, a higher contrast in text color for the logo was applied, alternative text was added to all images and icons, and all links we debugged to ensure they perform correctly aiding in the ease of navigation in the website. While these were some of the amendments made to the website to ensure the compliance for inclusion, I have learned that there are vast ways in achieving this outcome, and more particularly this will be a topic of ongoing education as what it means to be inclusive and the accessibility that goes with it evolves.
